Samosa Bot
-----------

Samosa bot is resposible for collecting activities and stats from different APIs and storing it in Redis. The bot runs every 30 mins. (Configurable)


API
---

**1. Add user details to Samosa**

Typical details include the type of product they are using, and credentials that would help pull data on user's behalf from device provider's API ::


    POST  /user

    Content-Type: application/json

        {
        "name" : "Balaji Iyer",
        "device" : {fitbit,vivofit,up,nikeplus,argus},
        "credentials" : apikey, {username, password}, customer secret
        }
   
   Example for fitbit:
   
   Content-Type: application/json
         
        {
        "credentials": {
        "client_key": "xx
        "client_secret": "xx",
        "resource_owner_key": "xx",
        "resource_owner_secret": "xx"
         },
        "device": "fitbit",
        "name": "balaji"
        }
        
   Example for jawbone-up:
   
   Content-Type: application/json
         
        {
         "credentials": {
         "Authorization": "Bearer xx
         },
         "device": "jawbone-up",
         "name": "Obul"
        }


**2. Get leaderboard** ::

    GET /leaderboard

    [
        {
            "user": "sriram",
            "rank": 1,
            "data": { "steps":100, "calories": 200, "distance": 2.8 },
            "rankingmetric": "steps"
        },
        {
            "user": "balaji",
            "rank": 2,
            "data": { "steps":80, "calories": 200, "distance": 2.8 },
            "rankingmetric": "steps"
        }
    ]

    By default, users will be ranked by steps, however the default ranking can be changed by passing a 'rankby' parameter.

    GET /leaderboard?rankby={steps,calories,distance}


**3. Get stats on a specific user** ::

    GET /stats?user={username}

    {
        "user": "sriram",
        "rank": 1,
        "data": { "steps":100, "calories": 200, "distance": 2.8 },
        "rankingmetric": "steps"
    }

UI
---

Samosa prints a leaderboard by making an AJAX request to the API. Check ui/leaderboard.html for the source.
